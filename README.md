# pro-multi_database_manager
Pro version of Multi Database Manager as a Java Swing application.

For all programmers, this is perfect repository to start-off with a java-swing application that manages multi databse viz MySQL, H2 and Oracle.

I have used Spring Tool Suite 4 as an IDE.

For testing the application, user needs to provide login credentials to connect to selected database. Once credentials are validated, user can select available Table-Schema from dropdown list. Then user can click on any basic CRUD Query button, once clicked general format of that query will be auto-generated in text field. Just click on Execute button to run the query instantly. 

NOTE : - I have added enhancement feature to auto-update table based upon CRUD Query execution. Also the table area is auto- scrollable based upon scroll event on table.
